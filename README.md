# Description
I created a project that mints NFTs of cars. I created a function called mintNFT() that takes in the car's brand, model, color, and year as parameters. The function then creates an NFT object with the metadata passed to it and stores it in an array. I also created a function called listNFTs() that loops through the array of NFTs and prints their metadata to the console. Finally, I created a function called getTotalSupply() that prints the total number of NFTs that have been minted to the console.

As a result of this project, I was able to mint two NFTs of cars: a Tesla Model X in black and a BMW i8 in blue. I was also able to list the metadata for each NFT and print the total number of NFTs that have been minted.
